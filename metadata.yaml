description: Elizabeth Ann, a nine-year-old girl, is timid and small for her age;
  she is also an orphan. At first she lives with her father's aunt, Harriet, who expects
  her to lead a very sheltered life. When she is sent to live with her mother's family,
  on a farm in Vermont, she is then expected to do many of the chores that Harriet
  had thought too demanding of a little girl. Elizabeth Ann, nicknamed Betsy, discovers
  her own abilities and gains a new perception of the world around her.
